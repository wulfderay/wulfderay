# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Mark.

I have been interested in computers since I took my first one apart when I was ten. The magic of how machines can think has excited me for as long as I can remember, and I have spent nearly my whole life discovering how they work. I started by repairing and rebuilding computers, learning everything that I could about the hardware and all the myriad things that could go wrong with them. I have taken apart and reverse-engineered virtually every piece of electronics that I have owned in my zeal to understand. After that I moved on to software, learning as many languages as I could. I have recently come full circle and am currently a firmware developer at [Shearwater Research](https://shearwater.com)
